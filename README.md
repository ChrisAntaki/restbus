restbus
=======

A Node.js RESTful JSON proxy server for the NextBus Inc. public XML feed.

The NextBus Inc. XML feed provides useful data to build real-time transit applications, but it ignores three key
components to the web:

* HTTP
* REST
* JSON

To interface with the NextBus Inc. XML feed over a RESTful JSON API, install and use **restbus** as a proxy server for
your application.
